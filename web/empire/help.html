<h3>EIT Empires In the Torus</h3>

This is a 2D stratagy game. The world is a torus. When the game start you have one city with a castle to protect it.
<p>

The object of the game is to find more cities and become the biggest empire in the torus.

<p>
To do this you will need 3 things: money, money & some other stuff.

<p>
Only cities with a castle or a townhall will pay taxes to you. All other units mobile or stationary will cost money.

But those can still be usefull since cities can only give you workers (called crew & engineer in the game) and money.

All real military units can only be built by farms, mines and docks.
<p>
Farms can produce wagons for transport and cavalry.
<p>
Docks can produce transport ships and military ships.
<p>
Mines can produce cannons and infantry units.

<p>
To get a mine/farm/dock you need to get an enginner to find a sector appropriate for respective building and order it to build the resource there.
A crew unit can also be used. Currently only the name is different between engineer and crew.
<p>
Remember to always keep an eye on you money, if you run out of money your units will not perform you orders.


<p>
Some more advanced units will require additional material. The frigate can only be built if yoe have cannons to put on it. Cannons can only be built at a mine. To move the cannon to the docks you need horse wagon. The wagon can only be produced at the farm. So you will need one of each of 3 resource sectors to build a frigate. 

<p>
This game is developed on mozilla/firefox linux desktop version so if you have problems please try that browser first. It does not work with MS Internet Explorer but it should work with other desktop browsers. 
<p>
We have tried to make it run mobile devices with mixed success. On Chrome for Android you may need a magnifying glas since it works only if you zoom out (using two finger pinch) the browser as much as possible. If you zoom (using two finger pinch) in tapping on the map will get incorrect positions. We will make the text larger when we have time to do so.
On Firefox for Android zoom works nicely but it will crash often. Like within one minute or two so be quick if you wish to use that browser.
