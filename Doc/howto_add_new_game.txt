How to add a new game.


Server:


In PlayerConnectionThread.startNewGame add the new game in typeNames and in "else if" list.
In this example new game is called Blocky.



Add a new class BlockyServer in RSB_Server that extends ServerBase.

Look att EmpireServer to se how following methods are to be implemented:

protected void join(BaseObj bo);
protected String createAndStore(String worldName);



In RSB_Common create new package.
In that package create a class BlockyWorld that extends GameBase. Look at EmpireWorld how to do that.

All objects that needs to be saved to disk or sent to clients need serializers!
These are called readSelf and writeSelf. Look at existing classes.
All variables in a class that needs to be saved to disk shall be added in readSelf and writeSelf.



For all your game objects create a base class.
Copy EmpireBase to BlockyBase.



Client:

Look at an existing game.
